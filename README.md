### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine. I use 3.12.
Sorry if there are 

### Installing

1. Install the required dependencies:

```

openai==1.7.2
python-dotenv==1.0.0
validator-collection==1.5.0

## Usage

create your own .env file and populate it with the following values:

MY_NAME=Your Name
MY_EMAIL=Your_Gmail_Address
MY_EMAIL_PASS=Your_Gmail_App_Password
OPENAI_API_KEY=The Api key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

p.s.
make sure you can actually send stuff from your gmail with this 2 step verification, more info: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_j6ILT-X0k

p.p.s
if you don't have tokens in your open AI api key, contact Turing college, they can sort you out, at least that's what Giedrius said.

To run the program, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python3 main.py

```
